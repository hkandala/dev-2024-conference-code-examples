One caveat of Kubernetes autoscaling is based on hardware resource utilization (CPU, memory) through Horizontal Pod Autoscaling. This causes a new challenge to build an event-driven serverless Java on Kubernetes because the event metrics from multiple event sources (e.g., Apache Kafka, AWS SQS) are more relevant than a pod's CPU usage for deciding when applications need to be scaled out and in.\n\nFortunately, KEDA and Knative on Kubernetes are designed to solve this challenge by autoscaling both standard apps and serverless by event metrics in a separate way. This session will teach you how to redesign your Kubernetes autoscaling architecture by event-driven metrics from Apache Kafka over standard resources (CPU, Memory) with Knative and KEDA integration for serverless Java using Quarkus."

Then you need engineers with the right skills to improve productivity and strengthen the engineering culture. However, it can be difficult to find experienced engineers to fill the gaps. Over the past few years, we at ING have found that hiring (external) trainees with little to no IT experience and investing in their development is a great way of meeting our talent needs.\n\nDuring this talk, attendees will learn (from a former trainee!) about the benefits we have experienced of hiring trainees. They will discover why investing in the development of these new workers can also help their organization to:\n\n1.        Meet their talent needs: by hiring trainees, organizations can build their own talent pipeline and reduce their reliance on external sources. This can help ensure they have the right people in place to meet their current and future needs. \n\n2.        Foster innovation: IT trainees bring fresh ideas and perspectives to the workplace. By investing in their development, teams can create a culture of innovation that drives growth and success.\n\n3.        Develop a positive, learning-oriented culture: Hiring IT trainees and investing in their development can create a positive culture that attracts other skilled workers. This can help to build a high-performing and productive technology team that drives business success. We’ve found that our trainees are energetic, motivated, and eager to grow and improve. This in turn has a positive impact on the culture in our teams.\n\nThis session is for you if:\n-        You’re interested in learning more about the advantages of hiring trainees\n-        Your team has had vacancies open for months and you’re open to new solutions\n-        You have some doubts, concerns, or questions about hiring trainees that you would like to see addressed by someone with practical experience"

    "abstract": "Managing large and heterogenous IoT fleets is complex and involves executing sets of operations (workflows), such as configuration management or over-the-air firmware updates. Integrity is key in rolling out configuration, bug fixes, and firmware. If integrity is not ensured, hasty rollouts of fixes to critical bugs and security vulnerabilities or new features introduce high risk to potentially leave devices in inconsistent states or bricked. Visibility, control and early evidence of success on a subset of devices is crucial before rolling out at full scale.\n\nWorkflows are often distributed (executed on-devices, as well as other systems), could be long running and need to survive device reboots, offline behavior and be rolled back in case of failure. Embedded devices are inherently constrained, and are not well suited for driving complex and distributed workflows.\nIn this session we will look at modelling workflows using Finite State Machines to break down complexity, and introduce an externalized, cloud managed approach to design, build, operate and remotely orchestrate resilient workflows, outside of the scope of specific request/response cycles and independent of device uptime.\n\nThe proposed design is accompanied by a concrete example implementation, which is evaluated against expectations such as system integrity and observability.

    "abstract": "Imagine being able to easily enter a foreign country with a QR code on your phone. Or maybe you want to apply for a new job, and are able to share referrals and qualifications without the need to contact a soul. What if getting a driver's license no longer required you digging through old utility bills and searching high and low for your birth certificate?\n\n\nAll of this is possible via a special kind of JSON Web Token (JWT) known as a Verifiable Credential. It turns out that the compact, transportable, tamper-resistant properties of JWTs make them perfect for so much more than just single sign-on. \n\n\nBecause JWTs contain JSON objects, just about anything can be expressed in them! Travel documents, employment status, college degrees, professional certifications, and just about any other skill, qualification, or aspect of identity can be in the form of a token - making it easy for users to prove attributes about themselves.\n\n\nIn this workshop, we'll dive into the nuts and bolts of creating Verifiable Credentials. You'll learn how to encode, decode, and effectively implement these tokens in real-world scenarios. By the end, we'll issue your very own Verifiable Credentials proving that you successfully completed the workshop 🎓"

    "abstract": "Engineering efficiency has become a burning topic with the ongoing downsizings and cost-cutting trends. Boards and investors demand visibility into the performance of the teams, while engineering leaders struggle to characterize engineering success.\nThis symptom reveals another root cause: relying solely on KPIs falls short on capturing the complexity of software engineering. They fail to encapsulate considerations such as juggling between priorities, managing technical debt, or navigating team management challenges. Engineering success takes a lot more than productivity: no business impact can be achieved without alignment to company goals; no results can be obtained durably without a fulfilling environment for the teams.\nI faced this issue of measuring and communicating engineering success myself as a VP Engineering, and shared my experience with hundreds of other engineering leaders. The solution I reached is based on three pillars:\nConnecting everyday engineering work to its purpose, and measuring the alignment of efforts to company goals. This helps shine a light on teams juggling with too many priorities, or drifting into non-priority topics.\nEmpowering your teams to monitor their delivery performance using various metrics, like DORA, in order for them to continuously improve, like a runner is tracking his performance through applications like Strava.\nFostering a healthy environment, where performance is measured on teams rather than individuals, and data is transparently accessible to all.\nThis framework helps your teams live up to their full potential and deliver a maximum impact. On the leadership side, collecting this data lets you communicate your teams' success through data rather than unsupported assertions."

Components such as custom applications, containers, virtual machines, operating systems, network components, and many more.\n\nThose agents collect information about the quality of the component based on customer behavior, such as clicking a JavaScript button or requesting information from an API. But also on interval by using a bot for executing these same requests from anywhere in the world.\n\n \n\nCentrally gathering and automatically analyzing all this information gives you the opportunity to have the system alert the owner on deviations helped by big data analysis, such as anomaly detection or more complicated machine learning jobs.\n\nObservability provides nice topology of your complete application landscape, it maps all dependencies and makes root cause analysis a piece of cake! But the real advantage of Observability is pro-active action: by automatically spotting smaller upfront indications of a possible degradation of the customer experience you can prevent that same degradation of the customer experience. An example of this is an anomaly in CPU usage of a database, which is correlated to the deviating latency of a request. Before the latency unacceptable an results in leaving customers the issue can be spotted, solved and thus prevented.\n\n \n\nI show that conventional monitoring is evolving in a holistic and automated way which provides teams and decision makers with powerful pro insights based on historical facts about the customer journey, which are needed to prioritize quick action and make new plans for an unforeseeable future. Moreover by 2025 EU law (NIS2) requires official representatives of organizations such as KvK to have their monitoring situation in check by making them responsible for being able to finish a root cause analysis within 24h when dealing with a cyber security attack.\n\n \n\nWith this presentation you learn what the difference is between conventional monitoring and Observability. It explains the concept of Observability, how it is implemented, how it is used, what span of control it provides and how its insights enable them to grow in a healthy way."
